Using KML SuperOverlays from TileCache
======================================

TileCache has support for KML superoverlays. For any TileCache layer for which
the source data is EPSG:4326, the KML Service provides GroundOverlay
data with LevelOfDetail NetworkLinks to deeper levels of data.

How to Use
----------

In order to display the KML data, there are two options:
 * Create a link to a single tile which contains your tile of interest.
   The tiling scheme for your data determines what the tile identifiers
   are. Tiles match those used by TMS.
 * Create a service that assembles multiple KML tile links into a single
   KML document. This service should use NetworkLinks to point to other KML 
   files to include. This service does not need to be comple: it simply
   needs to create small KML documents which include only a small number of
   networklinks, needed to link the user to an area.

A simple document which does this -- for a given layername -- is included
in doc/examples/overlay.kml.

This sample document is designed to make available an entire worldwide set
of tiles via TileCache: typically, one would create a more complex KML 
generator that would, for example, specify a LookAt tag as well, so that a user could open the data in Google Earth based on where they were looking.
Also, this KML file will let them zoom out -- but it means that the server 
does need to generate (possibly many) KML documents to get the viewer to 
where they want to be, because the KML Client will need to trawl its way
through the entire Pyramid down to where the user is viewing. However,
the image data is not included with the KML document, so this should be
a lightweight server side operation: it's just somewhat slow to do many
round trips, in general, so specifying (as a top level) some reasonaable
compromise between the whole world and the targeted viewing plane might make
sense.
