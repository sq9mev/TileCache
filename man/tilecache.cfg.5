.SH NAME
tilecache_clean.py \- remove least recently used map tiles from a cache
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I tilecache_clean.py
utility will remove the least recently accessed tiles from a cache, down to a
specified size.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "tilecache_clean.py [-h] [-s SIZE] [-e ENTRIES] \fIcache_location\fP"
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--version"
show program's version number and exit
.IP "-h, --help"
show a help message and exit
.IP "-s SIZE, --size=SIZE"
Maximum cache size, in megabytes. Defaults to 500.
.IP "-e ENTRIES, --entries=ENTRIES"
Maximum cache entries. This limits the amount of memory that will be used to
store information about tiles to remove, and is used to regulate
how much memory it uses to do its bookkeeping. The default value of 1 million
will hopefully keep RAM utilization under about 100M on a 32-bit x86 Linux
machine. If tilecache_clean.py doesn't appear to be keeping your disk cache
down to an appropriate size, try upping this value.
.SH CRON EXAMPLE
.TP
00 05 * * * /usr/local/sbin/tilecache_clean.py -s500 /var/www/tilecache
.PP
Note that, on non-POSIX operating systems (particularly Windows),
tilecache_clean.py measures file sizes, and not disk usage. Because most
filesystems use entire file blocks for files smaller than a block, running 'du
-s' or similar on your disk cache after a cleaning may still return a total
cache size larger than you expect.
